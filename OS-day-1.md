## windows persistence mechanisms
    powershell profiles - 
     highest order of presidence = all users, all hosts - if this profile setting is set, it'll apply to all users, all hosts.
     all users, current host - if this is set, the profile will be set to all users on current machine
     current user, all hosts - if this is set, it applies to a current user on all machines
     current user, current host - applies to one user on one host.

     how to check = test-path -path $profile.currentusercurrenthost

     if it comes back true, 'cat' the command as seen above.

     $profile - tells us where the current profile is stored at
