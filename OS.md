 ## open powershell, run as admin **POWERSHELL COMMANDS**

    **commands:**
    **pwsh** - gets you powershell version
    **history** - shows commands you've used
    **get-member** - shows properties, methods and definitions for command
    **get-process** - shows running processes.
     **example of using get process**  get-process | select name,id,starttime
    **get-content** - to read a file

    get-process | select name
    (get-process).name
    **start processes** - notepad.exe (opens notepad)
    start-process notepad
    stop-process -name notepad
    or
    start-process chrome
    (get-process chrome*).kill()
    
    get-process | get-member | where-object {$_.membertype -match "method"}

     attached drives cli - fsutil fsinfo drives
     
 ## transcripts

    start-transcript
     ** enter commands here **
     stop-transcript
     ** then navigate to location and view/rename transcript **


 ## CIM Classes
    use this command when dealing with things like bios, or other physical things on machine.
    get-cimclass *
     shows all of your cim classes
    get-ciminstance -class win32_bios
     shows all of your bios information

 ## adding and removing items

    new-item does_not_exist.txt (-erroraction SilentlyContinue)
    remove-item does_not_exist.txt (-verbose)
## variables
    get-variable - shows variables
    $processes = get-processes
 
    $today = (get-date).datetime
    $today
    Tuesday, April 2, 2024 1:04:08 PM
    remove-variable -name today
    or clear variable by using
    clear-variable -name today

## wildcards
    if using wildcards * before or after, use -match(matches or when using regex) or -like(looking for   something similar)

## execution policy
    get-executionpolicy
    set-executionpolicy -executionpolicy unrestricted -scope currentuser
    get-executionpolicy
    unrestricted

## windows persistence mechanisms
    powershell profiles - 
     highest order of presidence = all users, all hosts - if this profile setting is set, it'll apply to all users, all hosts.
     all users, current host - if this is set, the profile will be set to all users on current machine
     current user, all hosts - if this is set, it applies to a current user on all machines
     current user, current host - applies to one user on one host.

     how to check = test-path -path $profile.currentusercurrenthost

     if it comes back true, 'cat' the command as seen above.

     $profile - tells us where the current profile is stored at
     
## linux persistence mechanisms

    /etc/init, /etc/inittab and /etc/rd0.d
    Are all places to look for persistence in Linux
    /etc/environment
    Holds all environmental variables and can contain persistence
    /etc/profile 
    Holds script 
          -	Bash_profile and .bashrc
          -    scheduled tasks
          -    zombie or orphaned processes/damaen
          -    crontab
          /etc/profile
    /etc/profile.d/* (various scripts in /etc/profile.d/)
    /home/<username>/.bash_profile (this fails, I have no such file)
    /home/<username>/.bash_login (this fails, I have no such file)

## Windows Registry

    HKLM - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      HARDWARE - contains a database of installed devices along with their drivers
      SAM - Security Account Manager stores user and group accounts along with NTLM hashes of passwords
      Security - Local Security policy accessed by lsass.exe used to determine rights and permissions for users on the machine
      System - Contains keys pertaining to system startup such as programs started on boot or driver load order.
      
    HKU - HKEY_USERS
     contains user profiles on system. one key per user, each key is named after the SID of the user
     
    HKCU - HKEY_CURRENT_USERS
      is the copy of the logged in userâ€™s registry key based on thier SID from HKEY_USERS.
    HKCC - HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
    
    HKCR - HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT

    All hives in HKLM are stored in %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\config\ (%SYSTEMROOT% usually refers to C:\WINDOWS).

    view/manipulate registry - regedit.exe
## manipulating registry in cmd

    ex: opening registry in command line
    reg query HKLM\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run
    reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run /v testme /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
    reg delete HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v testme

## manipulating registry in powershell

    Get-ChildItem HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run ((reads sub keys from input value))
    Get-item HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run ((reads value of inputted object))
    New-Item "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Security\Trusted Documents\TrustRecords" -Force ((creates new sub key associated with hive))
    
    New-ItemProperty "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Security\Trusted Documents\TrustRecords" -Name "%USERPROFILE%Downloads/test-document.doc" -PropertyType Binary -Value ([byte[]](0x30,0x31,0xFF)) 

     New-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run -Name Test -PropertyType String -Value C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe 

      Get-LocalUser | select Name, sid ((to see local users & sids in powershell))

## PSDrives

    Get-PSDrive ((find current PSDrives))
    New-PSDrive -PSProvider Registry -name HKU -Root HKEY_USERS ((add a drive))

## Alternate Data Streams 

    https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/005_windows_ads/ads_fg.html
    echo Always try your best > reminder.txt
    echo social security numbers > reminder.txt:secret.info ((adds social security numbers to reminder .txt in ADS))
    more < reminder.txt:secret.info ((to view hidden ADS))
    or
    notepad reminder.txt:secret.info

    To determine if there is an ADS do:
    dir /R

  ## Linux Essentials
  
     https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/003_linux_essentials/bash_fg.html
     netstat -ano         to look at connections / ports
     pivot from port opening an executable - netstat -ano ((sudo netstat -ltup))
     ~ home directory
     / root directory
     file permissions       user,group,owner
     help information ls -- help
     or 
     man ls
     variables in linux:     a="100"       directories=$(ls /)
                             echo $a       echo $directories
                             100
     
     redirection -           echo $directories 1> thisisanewfile
     0 - standard input      cat thisisanewfile ((opens up your ls output from above))
     1 - standard output
     2 - standard error      ls bacon 2>/dev/null ((bacon doesnt exist, sends error message to the void))

     piping -                ls -Rlisa /etc | grep syslog ((R means recursive, grep is to search for a string)) 

     looping -                objects=$(ls -d /etc/*)
                              echo $objects
                              for item in $objects; do echo $item; done
                              or 
                              for object in $objects; do if [ -d $object ]; then echo "$object is a directory"; else echo "$object is a file" ; fi ; done

## Linux File Systems

    /bin directory - contains system binaries (commands like ls and echo)
    /home - contains directories for non root users
    /etc - contains configuration files, network configs, system services, firewall stuff etc
    /var - contains variable data, system logs etc.

    id - command that shows user id, group id etc. 
    cat /etc/passwd - also shows user information (might have to sudo it)
    ex: sudo cat /etc/passwd | grep garviel

    ex: man -k "digest"            searches man pages for something containing digest

    find ip's in a file:            cat numbers.txt | grep -Po '^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}$' | wc -l


 ## Windows Boot Process

    https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/006_windows_boot_process/winboot_fg.html
    
    lsass.exe - the Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS) provides user authentication services, manages the local security policy, and generates access tokens.

    services.exe the Services Control Manager (SCM) loads AutoStart services, using LSASS to authenticate if they run as something other than System.

    Ways to check services - 
     reg query hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\Spooler
     tasklist /svc

     bcdedit
     bcdedit /set {current} description "this is a description" ((to change something in bcd)
     
     To add stuff to bcd --
     bcdedit /create {ntldr} /d "win XP" -> bcdedit /set {ntldr} device partition=C: -> bcdedit /set {ntldr} path \downloads -> bcdedit /displayorder {ntldr} /addfirst

     to delete stuff from bcd --
     bcdedit /delete {ntldr} /f

     to restore backup -- 
     bcdedit /import C:\bcd.bk

 ## Linux Boot Process

    https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/007_linux_boot_process/linboot_fg.html
    MBR - first 512 bytes of the HDD
    lsblk - list block devices, shows disk spaces 
    ex:
    sudo xxd -l 512 -g 1 /dev/vda
    shows:
    Execute xxd to hexdump 512 bytes in separated by 1 byte from /dev/vda to the screen
    The start of the hard drive shown by the code eb 63. File signature for an MBR.
    The first partition of the hard drive in 0x01be shown as 80
    The second partition entry is blank!

    ex:
    dd if=/dev/vda of=MBRcopy bs=512 count=1
    shows:
    Execute dd which copies 512 bytes once from /dev/vda to a file in my current directory called MBR
    Notice, dd failed to run
    !! represents the previous command. Run it with sudo permissions.
    Execute file to read the file signature from the MBR file
    ((dd is a bit for bit copy))

    ex:
    cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    shows:
    look through kernel to see what config you're going to load
    
     ex:
     ltrace -S cat /etc/passwd
     shows:
     shows system calls in linux

     ex:
     /etc/rc3.d$ ls -l /etc/rc3.d/
     List the contents of the /etc/rc3.d/ directory
    
     ex:
     systemctl list-dependencies graphical.target
     list unit dependencies in tree-form

     ex:
     systemctl show -p Wants graphical.target
     show wants to individual units

     ex:
     systemctl list-unit-files
     list every individual unit file

     The /etc/environment file sets Global Variables. Global Variables are accessible by every user or process on the system. It is read once when the machine completes Init. Any changes to the file require a system restart for them to apply. ((persistence))
     ex: cat /etc/environment
     
    /etc/profile is a script that executes whenever a user logs into an interactive shell on Linux. its functionality depends entirely on the version of Linux being used. Ubuntu Linux uses it to set the BASH shell prompt by executing /etc/bash.bashrc and execute any script named *.sh in /etc/profile.d ((persistence))
    ex: cat /etc/profile 

     Unique to BASH(Bourne Again Shell) are .bash_profile and .bashrc. They execute on a per user basis for interactive logins only. Both files are located every userâ€™s /home directory. They are user specific configurations and freely editable by the owning user or root. ((persistence))

     linux persistence: etc/environment | inittab | /etc/profile | .bashprofile | runlevels
  

     How many wants dependencies does SystemD actually recognize for the default.target
     systemctl show -p Wants default.target | wc

## Linux Auditing and Logging

     https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/012_linux_auditing_&_logging/linlog_fg.html
     logging is controlled by syslog or journald
     Syslog stores its logs as human-readable text documents within /var/log. It is configured using files in /etc/rsyslog/
     
     view syslog configuration -> cat /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
     
      Filtering Syslog Output With Grep
      grep timesyncd /var/log/syslog

      Any logs having to do with logins and authentication attempts. . /var/log/auth.log - Authentication related events . /var/run/utmp - Users currently logged in .. Not in human readable format. Must use last command . /var/log/wtmp - History file for utmp .. Not in human readable format. Must use last command . */var/log/btmp - Failed login attempts

      Any logs having to do with programs. . Apache - Webserver (dir) . apt - Package Manager (dir) . /var/log/mysql.log

      SYSTEM - 
      /var/log/messages - Legacy Catch all

    /var/log/syslog - Ubuntu/Debian Catch all
    
    dmesg = Device Messenger (queires /proc/kmsg)
    
    Kernel Ring Buffer - Never fills
    
    First logs generated by the system

    Journald logs - 

    Journald or systemd-journald.service is the logging daemon for systemd init Linux systems. It logs everything in regards to *.units from unit startup status to logs generated by each individual unit. Journald stores its logs in binary form. journalctl is the open command that reads them.

     journalctl in its base form shows all the logs currently saved by journald. Warning, journald is verbose so it saves a lot of logs.

     ex:
     journalctl --list-boots
     journalctl -b b3076f6774b841e08c19236bf327f529
     journalctl -u ssh.service
     journalctl -u ssh.service --since "2 days ago"

     Select all of the IP addresses and ports using a single XPATH Union Statement
     xpath -q -e '//address/@addr | //ports/port/@portid' output.xml | md5sum

     This file is a conn.log made in Zeek (Bro) with data about TCP/IP connections.

    Use jq to locate and count the unique originating endpoint IP addresses in the file. Enter the number of unique originating IP addresses as the flag.
    jq -r '.["id.orig_h"]' conn.log | sort | uniq -c | wc -l


    This file is a conn.log made in Zeek (Bro) with data about TCP/IP connections.

    Use jq to locate and count connections where the destination IP sent more than 40 bytes to the source IP.
    jq -r 'select(.resp_ip_bytes > 40)' conn.log | sort | uniq -c

    Select every IP address with open (in use) ports using XPATH queries and XPATH axes.
    xpath -q -e '//ports/port/state[@state="open"]/../../../address/@addr | //ports/port[state/@state="open"]/@portid' output.xml | md5sum


 ## Memory Analysis

    Order of Volatility From Most to Least

    CPU registers, cache
    
    Routing table, ARP cache, process table, kernel stats, memory
    
    Temporary file systems
    
    Disk
    
    Remote logging and monitoring data
    
    Physical configuration, network topology
    
    Archival media - backups

    ex:
    What profile do you use in conjunction with this memory image?

    Use the following file (memory image) to answer the rest of the Memory Analysis challenges.
    
    0zapftis.vmem
     
     .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\0zapftis.vmem" imageinfo

     ex: to view history

     What command did the attacker type to check the status of the malware?

     .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\0zapftis.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 cmdscan
     
     ex:
     What are the last 7 digits of the memory offset for the driver used by the malware?
     .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\0zapftis.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 driverscan

     ex:
     The process running under PID 544 seems malicious. What is the md5hash of the executable?
      .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\0zapftis.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 procdump -p 544 -D .
      then
      Set-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\Users\andy.dwyer\Desktop\Memory_Analysis\'
      then
      Get-FileHash .\executable.544.exe -algorithm md5 ((run mppreference before everything maybe))

      ex:
       What remote IP and port did the system connect to?
      .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\0zapftis.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 connscan


  ## Active Directory

    https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/014_windows_active_directory_enumeration/active_fg.html
    Examples of suspicious accounts include:

    Administrator accounts that arenâ€™t known to the network owners
    
    Accounts that have been active outside of normal work hours
    
    Accounts that are nested in multiple administrative groups
    
    Service accounts logging into workstations
    
    Accounts that have logged in directly to the Domain Controller that are not normally authorized to do so
    
    This information can be collected through PowerShell and Windows Event Logs on the Domain Controller. Windows Logs are the best way to identify security issues.*

    *** use event viewer to check windows event logs ***

    Find the unprofessional email addresses. List the email's domain.
    Get-ADUser -Filter {EmailAddress -like '*'} -Properties EmailAddress | Select Name, EmailAddress

     
     ex:
     Find the accounts that contain unprofessional information in the description.
       Get-ADUser -Filter * -properties description | Select-Object Description,name

       ex:
       How many total users are members of the Domain Admins group?
        Get-ADGroupMember -Identity 'Domain Admins' -recursive | select name

      Windows persistence / launch mechanisms
         - run/run once keys
         - scheduled tasks 
         - Powershell profiles: testpath -path $profile allusersallhosts -> if true, cat what you just tested (test-path -path $profile.allusersallhosts)

     Linux Persistence:
         - bash profiles (etc/profile)
         - Cron (etc/cron or /var/spool/cron) ** if ya see something there, cat it, if permission denied try sudo *** sudo -l
         - init 
         - daemons
         - runlevels

     methodology - 

          - suspicious ports (repeating / sequential numbers)
             in linux - get ports and pids using (sudo netstat -ltup)
             netstat -ano/b

             find the process -> what started the process? -> find where the process was launched from, persistence mechanism, maybe multiple. 

     linux process tree - 

         ps -elf --forest

     windows process tree - 

        use sysinternals for process tree (procmon/procexp) don't forget autoruns for other things (scheduled tasks, runkeys etc)

          PORT/PID
           get-process <pid> | select name, id, path

           Windows Artifacts:
           https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/011_windows_auditing_&_logging/artifacts_fg.html
             recycle bin
           1** BAM - Pretty easy, just pulling registry location (suspicious paths, not sys32, maybe public/downloads)
           2** prefetch - alot of stuff to parse through
               jump list
               recent
           3** userassist - ROT13 
               browser

        EXTRA USEFUL SHIT - 

        Get-LocalUser | select Name,SID (find usernames and SIDS)
        Get SIDS in command prompt -> wmic UserAccount get name,sid
