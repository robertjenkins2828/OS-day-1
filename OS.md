     attached drives cli - fsutil fsinfo drives
     
 ## transcripts

    start-transcript
     ** enter commands here **
     stop-transcript
     ** then navigate to location and view/rename transcript **


 ## CIM Classes
    use this command when dealing with things like bios, or other physical things on machine.
    get-cimclass *
     shows all of your cim classes
    get-ciminstance -class win32_bios
     shows all of your bios information

 ## adding and removing items

    new-item does_not_exist.txt (-erroraction SilentlyContinue)
    remove-item does_not_exist.txt (-verbose)
## variables
    get-variable - shows variables
    $processes = get-processes
 
    $today = (get-date).datetime
    $today
    Tuesday, April 2, 2024 1:04:08 PM
    remove-variable -name today
    or clear variable by using
    clear-variable -name today

## wildcards
    if using wildcards * before or after, use -match(matches or when using regex) or -like(looking for   something similar)

## execution policy
    get-executionpolicy
    set-executionpolicy -executionpolicy unrestricted -scope currentuser
    get-executionpolicy
    unrestricted

## windows persistence mechanisms
    powershell profiles - 
     highest order of presidence = all users, all hosts - if this profile setting is set, it'll apply to all users, all hosts.
     all users, current host - if this is set, the profile will be set to all users on current machine
     current user, all hosts - if this is set, it applies to a current user on all machines
     current user, current host - applies to one user on one host.

     how to check = test-path -path $profile.currentusercurrenthost

     if it comes back true, 'cat' the command as seen above.

     $profile - tells us where the current profile is stored at

## Windows Registry

    HKLM - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      HARDWARE - contains a database of installed devices along with their drivers
      SAM - Security Account Manager stores user and group accounts along with NTLM hashes of passwords
      Security - Local Security policy accessed by lsass.exe used to determine rights and permissions for users on the machine
      System - Contains keys pertaining to system startup such as programs started on boot or driver load order.
      
    HKU - HKEY_USERS
     contains user profiles on system. one key per user, each key is named after the SID of the user
     
    HKCU - HKEY_CURRENT_USERS
      is the copy of the logged in userâ€™s registry key based on thier SID from HKEY_USERS.
    HKCC - HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
    
    HKCR - HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT

    All hives in HKLM are stored in %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\config\ (%SYSTEMROOT% usually refers to C:\WINDOWS).

    view/manipulate registry - regedit.exe
## manipulating registry in cmd

    ex: opening registry in command line
    reg query HKLM\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run
    reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run /v testme /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
    reg delete HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v testme

## manipulating registry in powershell

    Get-ChildItem HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run ((reads sub keys from input value))
    Get-item HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run ((reads value of inputted object))
    New-Item "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Security\Trusted Documents\TrustRecords" -Force ((creates new sub key associated with hive))
    
    New-ItemProperty "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Security\Trusted Documents\TrustRecords" -Name "%USERPROFILE%Downloads/test-document.doc" -PropertyType Binary -Value ([byte[]](0x30,0x31,0xFF)) 

     New-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run -Name Test -PropertyType String -Value C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe 

      Get-LocalUser | select Name, sid ((to see local users & sids in powershell))

## PSDrives

    Get-PSDrive ((find current PSDrives))
    New-PSDrive -PSProvider Registry -name HKU -Root HKEY_USERS ((add a drive))

## Alternate Data Streams 

    https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/005_windows_ads/ads_fg.html
    echo Always try your best > reminder.txt
    echo social security numbers > reminder.txt:secret.info ((adds social security numbers to reminder .txt in ADS))
    more < reminder.txt:secret.info ((to view hidden ADS))
    or
    notepad reminder.txt:secret.info

    To determine if there is an ADS do:
    dir /R

  ## Linux Essentials
  
     https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/003_linux_essentials/bash_fg.html
     netstat -ano         to look at connections / ports
     pivot from port opening an executable - netstat -ano ((sudo netstat -ltup))
     ~ home directory
     / root directory
     file permissions       user,group,owner
     help information ls -- help
     or 
     man ls
     variables in linux:     a="100"       directories=$(ls /)
                             echo $a       echo $directories
                             100
     
     redirection -           echo $directories 1> thisisanewfile
     0 - standard input      cat thisisanewfile ((opens up your ls output from above))
     1 - standard output
     2 - standard error      ls bacon 2>/dev/null ((bacon doesnt exist, sends error message to the void))

     piping -                ls -Rlisa /etc | grep syslog ((R means recursive, grep is to search for a string)) 

     looping -                objects=$(ls -d /etc/*)
                              echo $objects
                              for item in $objects; do echo $item; done
                              or 
                              for object in $objects; do if [ -d $object ]; then echo "$object is a directory"; else echo "$object is a file" ; fi ; done

## Linux File Systems

    /bin directory - contains system binaries (commands like ls and echo)
    /home - contains directories for non root users
    /etc - contains configuration files, network configs, system services, firewall stuff etc
    /var - contains variable data, system logs etc.

    id - command that shows user id, group id etc. 
    cat /etc/passwd - also shows user information (might have to sudo it)
    ex: sudo cat /etc/passwd | grep garviel

    ex: man -k "digest"            searches man pages for something containing digest

    find ip's in a file:            cat numbers.txt | grep -Po '^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}$' | wc -l


 ## Windows Boot Process

    https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/006_windows_boot_process/winboot_fg.html
    
    lsass.exe - the Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS) provides user authentication services, manages the local security policy, and generates access tokens.

    services.exe the Services Control Manager (SCM) loads AutoStart services, using LSASS to authenticate if they run as something other than System.

    Ways to check services - 
     reg query hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\Spooler
     tasklist /svc

     bcdedit
     bcdedit /set {current} description "this is a description" ((to change something in bcd)
     
     To add stuff to bcd --
     bcdedit /create {ntldr} /d "win XP" -> bcdedit /set {ntldr} device partition=C: -> bcdedit /set {ntldr} path \downloads -> bcdedit /displayorder {ntldr} /addfirst

     to delete stuff from bcd --
     bcdedit /delete {ntldr} /f

     to restore backup -- 
     bcdedit /import C:\bcd.bk

 ## Linux Boot Process

    https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/007_linux_boot_process/linboot_fg.html
    MBR - first 512 bytes of the HDD
    lsblk - list block devices, shows disk spaces 
    ex:
    sudo xxd -l 512 -g 1 /dev/vda
    shows:
    Execute xxd to hexdump 512 bytes in separated by 1 byte from /dev/vda to the screen
    The start of the hard drive shown by the code eb 63. File signature for an MBR.
    The first partition of the hard drive in 0x01be shown as 80
    The second partition entry is blank!

    ex:
    dd if=/dev/vda of=MBRcopy bs=512 count=1
    shows:
    Execute dd which copies 512 bytes once from /dev/vda to a file in my current directory called MBR
    Notice, dd failed to run
    !! represents the previous command. Run it with sudo permissions.
    Execute file to read the file signature from the MBR file
    ((dd is a bit for bit copy))

    ex:
    cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    shows:
    look through kernel to see what config you're going to load
    
     ex:
     ltrace -S cat /etc/passwd
     shows:
     shows system calls in linux

     ex:
     /etc/rc3.d$ ls -l /etc/rc3.d/
     List the contents of the /etc/rc3.d/ directory
    
     ex:
     systemctl list-dependencies graphical.target
     list unit dependencies in tree-form

     ex:
     systemctl show -p Wants graphical.target
     show wants to individual units

     ex:
     systemctl list-unit-files
     list every individual unit file

     The /etc/environment file sets Global Variables. Global Variables are accessible by every user or process on the system. It is read once when the machine completes Init. Any changes to the file require a system restart for them to apply. ((persistence))
     ex: cat /etc/environment
     
    /etc/profile is a script that executes whenever a user logs into an interactive shell on Linux. its functionality depends entirely on the version of Linux being used. Ubuntu Linux uses it to set the BASH shell prompt by executing /etc/bash.bashrc and execute any script named *.sh in /etc/profile.d ((persistence))
    ex: cat /etc/profile 

     Unique to BASH(Bourne Again Shell) are .bash_profile and .bashrc. They execute on a per user basis for interactive logins only. Both files are located every userâ€™s /home directory. They are user specific configurations and freely editable by the owning user or root. ((persistence))

     linux persistence: etc/environment | inittab | /etc/profile | .bashprofile | runlevels
  

     How many wants dependencies does SystemD actually recognize for the default.target
     systemctl show -p Wants default.target | wc
